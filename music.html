                Released on December 25th, 2023, <b><i>"When the Sun Burns Red, Think of Me"</i></b> was recorded as a Christmas gift for my father. It includes several piano pieces that I wrote during undergrad, and I wanted to share them
                with him in a way that would be easy to access. Each song was written for a specific person who had a significant impact on my life.

                As I was learning to animate, I decided to make a video for one of my songs. <b><i>"Tranquil Haze"</i></b> was my first attempt at this, and it took an entire day to render on my computer! This may be one of my favorites I've rendered to date, and I hope to create trippier animations in the future.

                <b><i>"What I Hope To See"</i></b> was my second attempt at animating a video for my music, and it took even longer to render. I was still new to Blender and did a horrible job optimizing the
                rendering process. The final animation took many days and warmed up my bedroom in the process. Now, I make sure to run my renders while I am out of the house...
